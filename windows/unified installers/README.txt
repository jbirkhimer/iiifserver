To make installers, without rebuilding anything on your own, you must only do the steps
written bellow in REQUIRED STEPS block.
If you change some binaries, you might have to also recompile some dependencies,
read Readme.txt in all folders for closer info, which files binaries are interdependent.
If no Readme is in some folder, than it doesn't need more info as there is nothing to change
(e.g. batch_files, Images, Readme, Virtual_Directory)
Files that you must download are not included because of their size or license (kakadu).
